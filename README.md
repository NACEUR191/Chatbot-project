# Chatbot-project
This project is a smart chatbot web app built with Streamlit, capable of understanding both typed and spoken questions.
Users upload a .txt knowledge base, and the chatbot uses TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity to find the most relevant response from the uploaded content. It also features real-time speech recognition using the microphone, making the interaction natural and hands-free.
